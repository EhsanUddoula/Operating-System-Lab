# DUOS 

A minimal operating system developed for the 3-2 Operating System Lab course. I implemented a bootloader and basic system calls, targeting ARM Cortex-M4 processors.

## Project Overview

DUOS is a teaching-oriented operating system demonstrating core OS concepts including:
- Boot process and initialization
- System call implementation
- Basic process management
- Hardware abstraction for ARM Cortex-M4

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
1. ARM toolchain (specify exact requirements)
2. (Any other dependencies)

### Build Instructions
```bash
make all
